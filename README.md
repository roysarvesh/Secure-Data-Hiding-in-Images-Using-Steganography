Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography


Overview

In the digital era, secure data transmission is crucial to prevent unauthorized access. This project implements steganography to hide text messages within image pixels using a password-protected encryption mechanism. The system ensures confidentiality by hashing passwords and validating image capacity before embedding messages. A Streamlit-based GUI provides an intuitive interface for seamless encryption and decryption.

Technologies Used

    Programming Language: Python
    Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Streamlit, PIL (Pillow), Hashlib
    Platform: Streamlit (GUI), Jupyter Notebook/VS Code (Development)

Unique Features

✅ Password-Protected Steganography – Uses SHA-256 hashing for enhanced security.
✅ Pixel-Level Encryption – Embeds both hashed passwords and messages securely.
✅ Capacity Validation – Ensures image size can accommodate the message before embedding.
✅ User-Friendly Streamlit GUI – Simple interface for encryption & decryption.
✅ Efficient & Lightweight – Works with PNG/JPG images without significant quality loss.
📥 Installation & Setup

    Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/roysarvesh/Secure-Data-Hiding-in-Images-Using-Steganography.git
cd Secure-Data-Hiding-in-Images-Using-Steganography

Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Application

    streamlit run app.py

 Usage
 Encryption (Hiding Message)

    Upload an image (PNG/JPG/JPEG).
    Enter the secret message.
    Set a password for protection.
    Download the encrypted image.

 Decryption (Retrieving Message)

    Upload the encrypted image.
    Enter the correct password.
    Retrieve the hidden message securely.
    
Future Scope

🔹 AES/RSA Encryption – For even stronger security.
🔹 Multi-Format Support – Extending to GIFs, BMPs, and video steganography.
🔹 AI-Based Detection Prevention – Making it resistant to steganalysis.
🔹 Cloud Integration – Secure cloud-based encrypted image storage.
🔹 Mobile Application – Developing an Android/iOS app for real-time steganography.
